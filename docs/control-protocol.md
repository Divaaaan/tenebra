# Control protocol

The desktop UI never touches the tunnel directly. A core sidecar process owns
sing-box and the wintun tunnel; the UI drives it over a local connection using
**line-delimited JSON** — one JSON object per line, UTF-8.

Three message kinds flow over the link:

- **requests** (UI → core) carry an `id` and a `cmd`;
- **responses** (core → UI) echo the `id` with `ok`, plus `data` or `error`;
- **events** (core → UI) are unsolicited, carry no `id`, and have an `event`
  field.

## Requests

| cmd                    | fields                             | returns                     |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `status`               | —                                  | `State`                     |
| `list_profiles`        | —                                  | `{ profiles: Profile[] }`   |
| `import_subscription`  | `url`, `name`                      | `{ profile: Profile }`      |
| `import_link`          | `link`, `name?`                    | `{ profile: Profile }`      |
| `remove_profile`       | `profile`                          | —                           |
| `refresh_subscription` | `profile`                          | `{ profile: Profile }`      |
| `connect`              | `profile`, `node?`                 | `State`                     |
| `disconnect`           | —                                  | `State`                     |
| `ping`                 | `profile`                          | `{ results: PingResult[] }` |
| `set_routing`          | `mode` (`smart`/`global`/`direct`) | `State`                     |
| `set_split`            | `mode` (`off`/`exclude`/`include`), `apps?` | `State`            |

```
request:  {"id":7,"cmd":"connect","profile":"p1","node":"n3"}
response: {"id":7,"ok":true,"data":{"state":"connecting","node":"n3"}}
error:    {"id":7,"ok":false,"error":"profile not found"}
```

If `node` is omitted from `connect`, the core picks the lowest-ping node.

`set_routing` and `set_split` only record the choice; like a routing change, a
new split takes effect on the **next connect** (live retuning would require
restarting sing-box). The returned `State` reflects the stored choice.

### Per-app split tunnelling (`set_split`)

`apps` is a list of executable file names matched case-insensitively against the
process that owns each connection, e.g. `["chrome.exe", "steam.exe"]`. Names are
normalized server-side (trimmed, lowercased, de-duplicated, sorted), so the
`State` echoed back may differ from the input order/casing.

- `off` — no split; the base routing `mode` decides everything. An `exclude`/
  `include` with an empty (or all-blank) `apps` list collapses to `off`.
- `exclude` — the listed apps go **direct** (out of the tunnel); everything else
  follows the normal routing for the current `mode`.
- `include` — only the listed apps go through the **proxy**; everything else goes
  direct.

The split config is **persisted** in the core's config directory
(`settings.json`, written atomically) so it survives a restart and is loaded
back into the reported `State` on launch.

```
request:  {"id":8,"cmd":"set_split","mode":"exclude","apps":["Chrome.exe","steam.exe"]}
response: {"id":8,"ok":true,"data":{"state":"idle","split":"exclude","split_apps":["chrome.exe","steam.exe"]}}
```

## Events

| event      | fields                                                              |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `state`    | `state` (`idle`/`connecting`/`connected`/`error`), `node?`, `error?`|
| `traffic`  | `up`, `down` (bytes), `up_rate`, `down_rate` (bytes/s)             |
| `log`      | `level` (`info`/`warn`/`error`), `msg`                            |
| `profiles` | none — signal that the stored profile set changed; re-run `list_profiles` |

The `profiles` event is emitted after a profile's stored data changes outside a
direct request — chiefly the background subscription auto-refresh — so the UI can
reload usage and node lists without polling. It is also emitted after a manual
`refresh_subscription` that changed anything.

```
{"event":"state","state":"connected","node":"n3"}
{"event":"traffic","up":10240,"down":51200,"up_rate":2048,"down_rate":8192}
{"event":"profiles"}
```

## Types

```ts
type State = {
  state: "idle" | "connecting" | "connected" | "error";
  node?: string;
  profile?: string;
  routing?: "smart" | "global" | "direct";
  split?: "exclude" | "include";  // omitted when off
  split_apps?: string[];          // normalized executable names; omitted when off
  error?: string;
};

type Node = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  protocol: "vless" | "hysteria2" | "amneziawg" | "shadowsocks" | "trojan" | "vmess";
  server: string;
  port: number;
};

type Profile = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  source: "subscription" | "manual";
  url?: string;          // subscription URL, kept locally and never logged
  nodes: Node[];
  updatedAt: string;     // RFC3339
  expiresAt?: string;    // from the subscription user-info header
  trafficUsed?: number;  // bytes
  trafficTotal?: number; // bytes
};

type PingResult = { node: string; rttMs: number; ok: boolean };
```

This contract is the boundary between `ui-desktop` and `core/control`.
